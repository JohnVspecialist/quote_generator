# Quote Generator

A project I did for fun to practice basic coding, it's a Python program that generates and displays random quotes.
You can add your own quotes too!

## Features
- Displays randomly selected quotes
- Allows the user to add new quotes

## How to run
Run `quote_generator.py` with Python by clicking the Run button or typing `python quote_generator.py` in the terminal.
